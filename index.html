                Welcome to the St. John's College Library. The Library at St. John's College is a jointly used space shared between
                classroom teaching and the more traditional library role.
                At break times the library becomes the central hub of the College and students can be seen playing
                chess, reading, studying, catching up with friends and generally just enjoying the cosy library space.
                Students and their whanau are welcome in the Library at any time.

                The library is full of resources, including an excellent fiction and graphic novel collection, books for
                reluctant and less able readers, popular magazines,
                as well as an extensive range of non-fiction and reference resources.

                From our library website students can access databases that hold resources to support research and the
                completion of assignments.
                We are keen to help students develop their information literacy skills and use textual and digital
                resources, to assist with study and to discover the right
                book to foster a love of reading. Students will need to see the Librarian to get the Username and
                Password to access these digital resources but once they have these they
                can access the resources at school and at home.
